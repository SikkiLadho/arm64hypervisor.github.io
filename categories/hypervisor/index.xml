      <title>Tutorial: Exception Levels</title>

      <description>Today, we try to write a simple bootable hypervisor binary with just a blank screen(have patience, we&amp;rsquo;ll make it print the hello world too, but in future). Exceptions levels define execution privelege at each level. There are 4 exception levels in ARMv8 architecture.
 Exception Level 0 (EL0): This Exception Level or Privelege Level is commonly used by userspace applications. Firefox, Libreoffice, VLC Media Player, VirtualBox are few examples of userspace applications.</description>

      <description>Exceptions levels define execution privelege at each level. There are 4 exception levels in ARMv8 architecture.
 Exception Level 0 (EL0): This Exception Level or Privelege Level is commonly used by userspace applications. Firefox, Libreoffice, VLC Media Player, VirtualBox are few examples of userspace applications. Exception Level 1 (EL1): Kernel and all privileged code associated with kernel works in EL1 execution level. Exception Level 2 (EL2): Hypervisor(including KVM) works in exception level.</description>

      <description>This is a series of tutorials that I never had a year ago when I decided to write a bare metal hypervisor on Raspberry Pi 4, Leo Hypervisor. I did not have prior experience with bare-metal or even kernel development. Therefore, I will be sharing all that I have learned in following series of tutorials. You are welcome to contribute to this project and I would also love to learn from you.</description>
